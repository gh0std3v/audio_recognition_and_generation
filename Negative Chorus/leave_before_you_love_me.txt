Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me

Ayy, ayy, leave before you love me
Ayy, ayy, leave before you love me
Ayy, ayy, leave before you love me
Ayy, ayy, leave before you love me
