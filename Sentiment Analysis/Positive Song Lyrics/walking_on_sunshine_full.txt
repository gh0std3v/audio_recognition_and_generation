I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'til the day
When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox
Gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me
You're coming around
Now I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
And it's starting to feel good, hey
All right now
And it's starting to feel good
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now I know that it's true
And I don't wanna spend my whole life
Just a waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no, no, no
I said, baby, I just want you back
And I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
And it's starting to feel good, hey
All right now
And it's starting to feel good
Yeah, oh, yeah
And it's starting to feel good
Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine
I feel alive, I feel a love
I feel a love that's really real
I feel alive, I feel a love
I feel a love that's really real
I'm on sunshine, baby
I'm on sunshine, baby
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
And it's starting to feel good, hey
All right now
And it's starting to feel good
I say it, I say it, I say it again, now
And it's starting to feel good
Oh, yeah
And it's starting to feel good
Starting to feel good
I say it, I say it, I say it again, now
And it's starting to feel good
And it's starting to feel good
Now tell me, tell me tell me again now
And it's starting to feel good
Oh, yeah
And it's starting to feel good
Starting to feel good
Starting to feel good
Now it's starting to feel good
And it's starting to feel good
And it's starting to feel good
And it's starting to feel good
