Let me tell you now
Here we go
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way (come on)
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do (hey)
Here come bad news talking this and that (yeah)
Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back (yeah)
Well, I should probably warn you, you'll be just fine (yeah)
No offense to you, don't waste your time
(Here's why)
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here go

Bring me down
Can't nothing (happy)
Bring me down
My level's too high (happy)
