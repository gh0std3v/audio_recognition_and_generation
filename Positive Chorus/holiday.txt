Lookin' for sun rays, needin' them good days
Fly me a way away, you're my holiday
Cool like the ocean, lost in emotion
Fly me a way away, you're my holiday
Whenever you're here, it's a good time
Strawberry shirts in the sunshine
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight
You're my holiday
Whenever you're here, it's a good time
Strawberry shirts in the sunshine
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight
You're my holiday
