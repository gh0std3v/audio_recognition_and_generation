'Cause I'm not givin' up
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not yet (Not yet)
Even when I'm down on my last breath (Last breath)
Even when they say there's nothin' left (Nothin' left)
So don't give up on
I'm not givin' up
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not me (Not me)
Even when nobody else believes (Believes)
I'm not goin' down that easily
So don't give up on me
